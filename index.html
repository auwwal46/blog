                When my cat won't eat the food I've given her, I give her “different food,” aka I pick up the dish,
                transfer said food to a different dish, and set said different dish back down. She then proceeds
                to gobble up said [same] food.
            </p>
            <p>
                There's a name for that effect. And it's one of nine psychological phenomena that I’m going to share
                with you today, that you can use in your copywriting.

                But before I do, I want to make one thing clear: I’m not in the business of tricking or coercing anyone
                into doing something they shouldn’t. That’s not effective copywriting.
